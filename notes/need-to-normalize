2. Risk: The Formatting Confound

A critical finding in your paper is the risk of probes capturing "surface correlates rather than underlying reasoning".

Looking at your JSON data, there is a distinct structural difference between the two classes:

Non-Empathic: Uses Markdown Headers and Bold Text (e.g., **Strategic Analysis and Action Plan**, **Resource Allocation Decision**).

Empathic: Uses standard paragraph structures without headers or bolding.

The Danger: If you extract probes using Mean Difference  on this specific dataset, your probe might learn a "Markdown/Formatting" direction rather than an "Empathy" direction. The model might classify any text with bold headers as "Non-empathic," regardless of the content.

Solution: You must normalize the formatting. Either strip the headers from the non-empathic examples or add similar structural headers to the empathic ones to ensure the probe captures the sentiment, not the syntax.
