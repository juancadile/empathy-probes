## Abstract
We investigate whether wellbeing prioritization (operationalized as willingness to sacrifice task efficiency for human welfare) can be detected as a linear direction in transformer activation space. This preliminary study extracts probe directions from Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct using contrastive pairs generated by Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-4 Turbo. Detection: The probe achieves AUROC 0.96-1.00 on held-out test data (15 pairs, 30 examples), with layer 12 showing perfect discrimination. While this indicates strong linear separability, perfect AUROC may reflect prompt artifacts (formulaic phrasing) rather than deep empathic reasoning. Lexical ablation experiments (203 keyword replacements across 41 empathy terms) show AUROC remains 1.0, suggesting robust semantic representation rather than keyword detection. Probe projections correlate with behavioral scores (Pearson r=0.71, p<0.01), though circularity risks exist given shared task-conflict framing. Intervention: Extended steering experiments (300 samples, alpha in [-10, +20]) reveal layer-dependent effects: Layer 12 achieves 93% success at extreme strengths (alpha=20, 4-7x typical values), while Layer 8 shows minimal steering (13%) despite near-perfect detection (AUROC 0.991). This detection-causation dissociation demonstrates that high AUROC does not guarantee manipulability, suggesting AUROC may measure separability rather than causal involvement. Extreme alpha requirements and lack of activation patching limit strong causal claims. We propose task-free scenarios and causal mediation analysis as critical next steps.
