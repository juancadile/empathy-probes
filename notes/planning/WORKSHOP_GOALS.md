# Workshop and Venue Strategy (Nov 14, 2025)

Got you — **given the date (Nov 14, 2025)**, these are the **realistic, strong-fit venues still open** (or opening soon) where your paper *can actually still be submitted this cycle.*

I'll give you:

1. **Where you can still submit in 2025–2026 (UPDATED timeline)**
2. **Which ones are best fits for THIS paper**
3. **Which ones are still non-archival (so you can later publish a stronger version)**

This is the cleanest, actionable version.

# ✅ 1. What is STILL open for submission? (as of Nov 14, 2025)

### 🔹 **FAccT 2026 Workshops**

Workshops usually open **Feb–Mar 2026** and accept in **April**.

**Great fit** for your paper, because they love conceptual–empirical hybrid work, especially around:

* empathy, wellbeing, socio-emotional constructs
* the gap between detection and causation
* interpretability + ethics

Workshops are **non-archival** → safe to submit your arXiv v0.

---

### 🔹 **ICLR 2026 Workshops**

ICLR main track deadline is past, but workshops open around **Jan–Feb 2026**.

**Strong fit** for mech-interp / probes / safety.

---

### 🔹 **ICML 2026 Workshops**

Deadlines typically **May 2026**.

This is one of your *best* matches:

* RepEng Workshop
* Mech Interp Workshop
* ML Safety Workshop
* Alignment / steering / causality workshops

All extremely welcoming of this kind of "empirical but early-stage" work.

---

### 🔹 **NeurIPS 2026 Workshops**

Those deadlines will be **October 2026**.

Far in the future, but still a relevant target.

---

### 🔹 **IEEE CAI 2026 (Workshops + Posters)**

IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence
Deadline usually **March–April 2026**.

CAI workshops/posters accept:

* early empirical safety work
* interpretability
* activation steering
* conceptual contributions

Your paper fits perfectly.

---

### 🔹 **IEEE Big Data Workshops (2026 edition)**

AI Safety / Ethics & Trust workshops often run with late deadlines (**August–September 2026**).

Good fit for representation work and probing.

---

### 🔹 **AAAI 2026 Workshops (Jan–Feb deadlines)**

AAAI main is closed, but **workshops** remain open.

Good matches:

* AAAI SafeAI Workshop
* AAAI Human-AI Interaction
* AAAI Interpretability and Explainability

---

### 🔹 **AIES 2026 Late-Breaking / Extended Abstract Track**

Not the main track (too late),
BUT AIES usually allows:

* "late-breaking abstracts"
* 2-page extended abstracts
* posters accepted into the program

Deadlines around **Feb 2026**.

And your paper is a *great* fit there.

---

### 🔹 **EA/AI Alignment Workshops**

These are scattered but ongoing all year:

* AI Safety Unconference (various cities)
* ML Safety Symposium
* Alignment Jamboree
* ML Collective workshops

These are extremely receptive to probing work.

---

# 🟢 2. **BEST FITS**, GIVEN WHAT THE PAPER ACTUALLY IS

Based directly on the paper content:

### **Absolute matches:**

These venues love:

* activation probes
* steering failures
* linear representations
* empirical safety gaps
* causal interpretability

So the best fits are:

### ✔ **ICLR 2026 Workshops (Interpretability / RepEng)**

### ✔ **ICML 2026 Workshops**

### ✔ **FAccT 2026 Workshops**

### ✔ **IEEE CAI 2026 Workshops**

### ✔ **AAAI SafeAI Workshop 2026**

These are the highest-status viable options for THIS cycle.

You could *easily* get in.

# 🔵 3. **Which venues are non-archival?**

Very important for your timeline because:

* you can post arXiv now
* you can submit to workshops
* later convert into a real top-tier paper

Non-archival venues where you can still submit:

* **All ICLR workshops**
* **All ICML workshops**
* **Most FAccT workshops**
* **NeurIPS workshops (2026)**
* **Most IEEE and AAAI workshops**

These allow you to:

**Submit now → build more experiments → convert into real NeurIPS/AIES/FAccT main-track paper later.**

---

# 🎯 **My Recommendation (practical + strategic)**

**Step 1 – Post on arXiv as v0**
There is NO problem doing this.

**Step 2 – Submit the current version to:**
👉 **ICLR 2026 interpretability / RepEng workshop** (Jan–Feb)
👉 **AIES 2026 extended abstract track** (Feb)
👉 **FAccT 2026 workshop** (Mar–Apr)

You will almost definitely get at least one acceptance.

**Step 3 – Over winter + early 2026**
Add:

* activation patching
* adversarial dataset
* cross-model tests (Gemma, Llama)
* generalization to non-task-conflict empathy tasks

**Step 4 – Turn this into your NeurIPS 2026 or AIES 2027 main-track paper.**

This roadmap is realistic AND matches your research trajectory.

# 🔥 If you want, I can also provide:

* exact workshop names + links
* calendar with dates
* a rewritten workshop-style abstract
* a 4-page AIES-style version
* a stronger arXiv v1 version
* a timeline for upgrades for main-track submission

Just tell me what you want next.
