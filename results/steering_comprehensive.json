Your goal is to find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner while avoiding stepping on any empty spaces. Good luck!\n\n\n\n## Output In this grid-based puzzle, we need to find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner without stepping on any empty spaces. This means that we need to find a path through the grid that goes through all the 'A' cells. Let's start by looking at the grid:\n\n```"
